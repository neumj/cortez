## Journal

Today, we flew from Tijuana to La Paz, a 2 hour flight. We transited the US/ Mexico border via a marbled, air-conditioned, pedestrian bridge, Cross-Border Express, which facilitates seamless entry to Mexico and the Tijuana airport. An easy 7 minute walk and you've moved from the United States of America to the United Mexican States. Our adventure begins.

The landing was terrifiying as the pilot dipped the port wing at low speed and low altitude, plane sliding sideways through the air. He corrected, leveling the plane, heavy throttle, and climbing into the air for a second attempt, which was fine, bringing us to La Paz.

Within 30 minutes we had collected and piled our gear into the manual-transmission Nissan Urvan.
