## Journal

Technically, the day started extremely early with anchor watches from the first minutes of 19 June through to the dawn. The sunrise painted a pastel beginning, dark forms of frigate birds and pelicans moving through the sky hunting bait fish below. After re-positioning _Grieg_, ceding appatently valubale territory to the bees and wasps, we headed for the shore. Michael, Amy, Magda, Maks, Aleks, Tobias, and Asher took the dinghy to the main beach of Ensenada Grande. Michael and Amy undertook a short hike up the main canyon which provided a postcard view of the valley, beach, and anchorage. Magda and boys enjoyed the beach, snorkeling, and exploring the shallow cove. Upon returing from the hike, we noticed thousands of small fiddler-crabs along the lagoon-land interface. The boys then spent time herding the crabs and exploring the lagoon.

No wind meant a motor-sail with hopes of a building breeze. Impromptu stop in Caleta El Embudo, which wildly exceeded expectations with a bed of thousands of Cortez Garden Eels swaying on the bottom, retreating as we dove to inspect. Many, many, varied fish which we try to remember and compare to our laminated marine life illustration card. After pulling the anchor from sandy bottom if Caleta El Embudo, we motorsail around Los Islotes to visit the sea-lion rookery and then onto Isla San Francisco. Little to no wind keeps us under motor and gives Asher and Aleks an opportuity to lounge in the main-sail. We opt to head to the north end of Isla San Franciso to explore the lagoon, Tobais hoping to find a hammer-head shark nursery. Alex and Asher undertake some "_Navy Seal Training_" hanging off the side of the dinghy as we sped to shore. Lagoon is heavily brackish and seems to not have regular interchange. Isla San Franciso presents a stunning landscape, rising from the sea.

Given our experience the previous night with _The Coromuel_, we opt to anchor on the east side of Isla San Francisco for the night. Swimming and jumping off the bow ensues as Zarko wrangles the grill into submission and production of heat. Before sunset we survey the bay to scout for viable night snorkeling locations, which after dinner, yields a first-time night snorkel for Tobias, Amy, and Magda. Under the glow of the Milky-Way we see varied fish, many large puffer fish, large spotted box fish, WORM, and 2 surly green eels, which simultaeoulsy leave us in awe and stike fear. Asher, Alex, Maks, and Zarko learn the differnce between fishing and catching, losing several large fish and breaking a rod before landing a Cortez Grunt. Anchorage is filled with biolomuneence; the sea miminincing the sky above with swilring constellations of light.
