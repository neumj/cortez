# Our Log of The Sea of Cortez (June 2023)

In June 2023, our two families, the Neumann's and Popov's, endeavor an adventure together at sea. We spend 7 days sailing _Grieg_, a 46-foot Dufor sloop, on the Sea of Cortez. We sail a loop from the southern point of La Paz to the northern point of San Evaristo and back. We enjoy Fathers Day and Summer Solstice at sea and visit the jewels of Isla Partida, Isla San Francisco, Isla San Jose, and Isla Espiritu Santo. Our intrepid crew:

- Michael (50)
- Amy (47)
- Zarko (43)
- Magdalena (40)
- Tobias (12)
- Asher (10)
- Aleksandar (10)
- Maksim (5)
