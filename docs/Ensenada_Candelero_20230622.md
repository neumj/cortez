## Journal

In the morning, Michael and Tobias are picked up in a 24-foot panga by a local scuba diving guide and head to a local wreck and island for 2 scuba dives.

In the late afternoon, 

- hike
- goats

- evening snorkel around El Candelero, green eels, many spotted box fish

We surface to a burning sunset and quickly return to boat
float together watching the sun SOMTHING the Gigante Sirria of Baja Californina Sur

Tobias opts to sleep under the expanse of the Milky Way wrapped in the main-sail lazy jacks, masthead light tracing a pendulum arc across constellations and galaxies. We are all jealous.

## Scuba Diving

_Fang Ming: Revenge of the Tortugas_

Dove the _Fang Ming_, a Chinese fishing trawler that was confiscated and subsequently sunk by the Mexican Navy for illegal fshing and human trafficing. Wreck dive, max depth of 21.3 meters, bottom temperature 26 degrees. Landed in sandy bottom at 21.3 meters, starboard side of the wreck. Always odd to see a massive ship sitting on the bottom of the sea floor. Forward to the bow, coverd in sea fans. Around the bow, down the port side and up to 18 meters. Penetrated the prot side, moving athwartships, exiting the starboard. Interior excrusted, many fish. Torch on, Tobias expertly navigates his first wreck penetration. Re-enter the starboard side and begin to move aft through what was likely crew living space and fish processing area, many large fish hiding in the corners, schools for Cortez Rainbow Wrasse. Tobias, again expertly navigates a confined space with limited overhead. Exit onto the stern deck, cargo holds open. Turtles lounging on the aft deck now ownig the ship that once likley illegally hunted them. From the center of the aft deck over the port rail and forwad to the pilot-house, slowly peeking over the port rail we spot a massive, male, green sea-turtle. A green eel pokes its head out of a port hole. Through the port pilot house door, which is _very_ tight, I get stuck for a moment. We have to go single file through the small pilot house. Many small Jewelled Moray eels throughout the wreck living on pipes and crevases. Out the starboard pilot house door and to the bow, anchor windlass still intact, more sea turtles, one lounding on the bow mast head, which we get to briefly swim with. Amazing dive.

_Tail of the Whale: Tranquillo_

Dove the western tail of Isla Ballena, a small island just south of Ensenada Candelero. Max depth 17.2 meters, bottom temperature 25 degrees. Landed in jumbled rocks, moving west along the sand-rock interface. Large school of Cortez Sea Chubs moving to deep water. Many nudibranchs, at least 4 types. Tobias observes a nudibranch, which is wrapped around a piece of seaweed, attack its own tail, extending its mouth onto itself. Giant hawkfish. Green Eeels. First part of the dive progresses like a cool sub tropical pacific dive, jumbled rocks, sea stars, sea cucuumbers. As we ascend from 15 meters to 10 meters we pass through a sharp thermocline, schlerring, and the entire ecosystem transitions to a tropical environemnt, replete with colorful schools of fish and sand flats dotted by rocky outcrops. Stong current transitions the dive into a drift and we float along the observing the tropical aquarium.
