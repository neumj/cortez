## Journal

In the morning, wind fresh and building form the north, we motor, wind on the nose to La Amortajada, a mangrove-forest lagoon encircled and protected by a massive sand spit. Enroute we spot jumping Dorado propelling their turquois-yellow-green masses out of the water either in pursuit of prey or being pursued as prey. We arrive to La Amortajada on a flooding tide and take the dinghy in 2 shifts to explore the mangrove forest, Neumann Family on Trip 1, Popov Family on Trip 2.

Inside the sand spit bastion lies a vast mangrove ecosystem ranging from clear sand-bottom shallows to dense mangroves cut with tidal channels, silty and tannic dark waters. Many sea tutrles, unidentified fish, rays, potential baby hammer-head sharks, sea birds and raptors.  

Neumann Family arrives at the lagoon opening during a strong flood tide, channel unnavigable, water heavily rushing over a rocky bottom as the morning exchange with the sea begins. Michael, Amy, Asher, and Tobias exit the dinghy and drag the tender across the rocks and into the lagoon, then falling into the deep drop-off just inside the lagoon. We scramble back into the boat and explore the mangroves sometimes under power, sometimes drifting silently under paddle or walking slowly in sand-botom or silty-muck bottom pulling the dinghy. Exiting the lagoon is equally chaotic as the flood tide is still strong and water depth not navigable. We slightly miss-time the exit from the dinghy to walk it across the laggon entrance and in the seconds of miss-timing Asher and Tobias exit the bow, Amy and Michael off the stern into shoulder deep, rushing water, that renders them useless in moving the dinghy. Mild panic ensues and the boat begins to be swept back into the lagoon. Asher and Tobias have to pull the dinghy, Amy and Michael holding on, to a point that all can work to move the boat through the entrance. It is slow going as the under-powered dinghy struggles against the flood, and we beleive we spot juvenile hammer heads also transiting the entrance.    

During Trip 1, local fisherman approach _Grieg_ and ask the Popov Family for some water, they share a 6 liter jug of water, a precious commodity for us on a boat in 100-degree temperatures. The fisherman retreat to the shade of foiliage along the crest of the sand spit, seeking refuge from 100 degree temperatures and strong north winds.  

As we leave La Amortajada, the wind is gusting above 20 knots from the north and we are again motorsailing on the nose, on our way to the fishing village of San Evaristo.

We tuck into the northern lobe of the bay and anchor in sandy bottom in 3 fathoms of water. Swimming and snorkeling with decent visibility of 20 feet, various fish, among rocky bottom interspersed with sand. Asher hones his diving skill hunting for shells.

We discover a large grass hopper lounging on our bimini and name him Pin. We wonder how long he haas been transiting, could he have been a co-resident with us from La Paz? We decide it is best to release him on land and begin to make plans to hold him in a container and make a trip to shore to release him.

Mild panic ensues as the continuous running water pump and gurgling sound of an empty water tank alerts us to the fact that we have exhisted half our water supply in 3 days. We switch to the second tank, and thankfully realize we can take the dinghy into town to scrounge for water. We first re-inlate and restructure the crushed plastic water bottles we have been discarding as we use our potable water supply, it is, afterall, Mexico, which means you must only drink bottled water. Then, off we go, under the sputtering engine of the dinghy, into the fishing village of San Evaristo; Michael, Zarko, and Tobias, with 6, 6-liter, empty platic jugs, in search of water. An hour later we are headed back to _Grieg_ with 6, full, 6-liter jusgs, and a 40-liter carboy that we have borrowed from our new local fisherman friend Augustino. Tobias releases Pin. An hour after that, we have partially filled _Grieg's_ watertank, forced 200 pesos into the hand of Augustino, and parted with 2 bottle of wine for his deeply human kindness to share one of the most preciosu assets in this extreme desert environment. Deep thanks for the knindness of this human, and interesting full circle moment as we have today shared the preciosu commity of water and recieved a ten-fold kindness.

Our first moon-rise of the trip presents as a waxing yellow-orange crescent accompanied by Jupiter rising over the encircling, rocky, hills. It sets equally beautifully and as the boat swings comes back into view gracing us with a second moon-set. As darkness fills biolominesecene fills the bay.
