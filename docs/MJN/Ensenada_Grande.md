# Ensenada Grande: 19 June 2023

**_00:27_**

Swining on the hook again, wind waves lapping our hull in 4 fathoms, stars above, and ink blackness surrounding. I'm sitting the second-shift achor-watch as a gusty wind to 17kts buffets our boat, swinging us on a 90 degree arch. We've come to the Sea of Cortez and this is our first night out of La Paz. Our route and observations from day-one are documented elsewhere, so here, I'll only say, this has been one helluva Father's Day. Thankful for all the monements that have brought me here.

We flew from Tijuana to La Paz on Friday, June 16 2023, transiting the US/ Mexico border via a marbled, air-conditioned, pedestrian bridge which facilitates seamless entry to Mexico and the Tijuana airport. An easy 7 minute walk and you've moved from the United States of America to the XYZ of Mexico. It is a short distance across an invisible boundary, but the change is real. Observing the people in the airport, and the passengars on the flight, I was struck by the differnces of morphology, clothing, tone, and demeanor of the populous when compared to the citizens on the US side of the border. In this hyper-conected world where nearly all things flow freely, how can there be such a ditinct differnce of demographics in such little distance? It seems the natural diffusion of culture, genes, and ethos should create a more homogeneous distrubution. This dicontinutiy becomes even more of a paradox when we purchase a carton of blue-berries in La Paz, Mexico, that are the same as the ones we purchase in Mission Viejo, California. How can commodites be _identical_ over a vast distance, while people and culture have a marked discontinutiy over a mostly permeable and permissive border? It seems human existence and condition should be more homogenous, more evenly distributed, over space and time.

_Coromuel_: Storng winds that begin in the evening and blow through the night, created by cool air from the Pacific Ocean flowing across the low land of the Baja Peninsula towards the warmer waters of the Sea of Cortez. South to Southwesterly.

Had read about Coromuels in pilot guides. Steinbeck dedicates some words to them. I didn't expect "evening" to translate to 21:30, and didn't expect to contend with them on night one. Poor choice of anchorage given the description for Ensenada Grande of: "With the anchorage open to the soputhwest, little protection is available during periods of night time coromuel winds." Swinging in darkness.

Wind may be begining to slack, going forward to the bow to gaze upon the Milky Way.

Sun just begining to crest the valley ridge of the large beach in Ensenada Grande. Frigate birds and pelicans are using the oblique sun angle to hunt their morning meal, lofting on the southwestern breeze and then plunging into the water to scoop a meal.
