The plan is a morning transit and then a long day at anchor in Estero Balandra, enjoying the beach and waters before pulling hook and relocating closer to La Paz. This will position us for a short final return transit morning of 24 June 2023. If we can, however, we'll stay in Estero Balandra. We are anchored by late morning fronting a beach in 6 fathoms, sandy bottom. Some of the crew head to the beach, some remain on the boat. After the beach excursion, we take Griegito Conchito into the reserve to dive a small reef. No anchoring is permitted, so we'll hot-boat while most of the crew snorkels. </p> <p>On our way to the reef, we spot a dark, shape-shifitng mass, likely a bait ball. Tobias dons his gear and plummets into the middle of thousands for Cortez Sea Chubs. I circle the reef while Amy, Zarko, Tobias, Asher, and Aleks snorkel. The large school of chubs is pressing against the reef and Asher and Aleks dive through the shifting school. It's like being on a rush hour highway of fish, very little light or space in between each individual. Moving in the current with them is a very different experience than moving in opposition. One seems to occasionally turn on it's side as some sort of distraction, flickering silver. The reef is good with many tropicals and decent coverage of live coral. Amy takes a turn on the tiller while I make a quick survey of the reef, mainly swimming in the bait-ball of chubs. We take a final swing through the southwest lobe of Estero Balandra, revisting the first snorkel spot of the trip, a jumble rock-reef habitiat. It is again filled with many tropicals, Asher spots a zebra moray eel and after the intial awe, protects Mum from the specimen. Tobias and I venture through the underwater swim-through several times. Great spot. I could do this all day. Future return is a must.</p> <p>We return to Grieg, pack our gear, confirm we cannot anchor in Estero Balandra, and pull the hook, headed for Caleta Lobos. Caleta Lobos is a small bay with two lobes to the northeast, each ending in mangroves. Amy, Michael, Asher, Tobias, Maks, Magda, and Aleks run Griegito Conchito to the mangrove lined beach for a final exploration. In the mangroves, we spot a jeweled moray eel and, unbelievably, watch it hunt and capture a crab. The eel slides into the mangrove roots and we continue to watch as it hunts. Asher lingers and sees it catch a small fish. Tobias finds a very dried out ray on land and decides to honor it's life by setting it back in the water. </p> <p>We ride out, past the tiny fish camp. This place is just everything different, quiet, simple.</p> <p>We board Grieg and a dance party ensues to I Ain't Worried by One Republic, the theme of our holiday.

The action triggers chaos as Michael and the boys move rapidly to get on snorkel gear on. The moubula rays pass the bow and we are launch off the stern, soon in pursuit, as the rays breach their way across the cove. The rays escape interaction but several breach and land within 15 to 20 feet of us.</p> <p>After the excitement of the chase, Amy, Zarko, Magda, Maks, Aleks, and Asher take the dinghy into the village of San Evaristo to purchase fresh fish from Augustino. Tobias and Michael wrangle the anchor aboard and move the boat closer to the village for a hot-boat pick-up. A mobula ray nearly lands on the swim step as we hold the boat for the shore crew. In the village the land crew giggles as Augustino's dogs chase one another, entering and exiting the small surf. Asher says they are the Mexican version of Hmfis and Fig. The dark female is very wary of us and keeps her distance, while the spotted male is happy to receive scratches and lean on the human volunteer. Zarko, Amy, and Magda purchase fresh Conchita from Augustino, possibly the Cortez Sea Chub. Augustino offers his daughter's ceviche preparation skill if we can only wait an hour and a half. We have a long sail ahead and opt to return in the future for a fresh ceviche. </p> <p>We manage a hot-boat pick up from the dinghy and depart San Evaristo at 10:17 under a north wind of 10 to 15 knots and building. Our destination lies 32 nauticals miles south, which Tobias has determined the day before via chart, compass, and parallel rule. We raise sail and run downwind, wing and wing, sea and winds building through the day.</p> <p>Amy and Magda join the Mariners' Club, alongside Tobias, learning the art of navigation, determining and plotting our postion, and charting our course as we run to Isla Partida.</p> <p>The dinghy earns a name, Griegito Conchito, as we watch it surf and bob along as we tow it behind us in 20 knots of winds and 1 meter seas.</p> <p>In the early afternoon, winds are gusting to 25 knots and seas running out of the north at 1 meter, lifting our stern rythmically. As we reach the trough of a deep roll, we spot a large manta ray surfing our direction, we attempt to chase the massive creature downwind, without success. On our final approach to Caleta Partida we spot dolphins off the port bow, and as soon as we see them, they are gone. We again spot them to our stern, their large bodies and slow movement leads us to believe they may be Rizzo's Dolphins. We are on anchor in sand bottom by 15:30. </p> <p>The shallows of Caleta Partida are replete with turtles, rays, bait fish, and sea birds. We spot an eagle ray and each family spots schools of rays and turtles as they take Griegito Conchito through the cut between Isla Partida and Isla Espiritu Santo, which provides a corridor to the open Sea of Cortez. We take a few moments to explore the shallows and coarse white-sand beach that provides a butress between the islands. It is paradise in the warm water where we even dig up a few tiny clams for inspection.</p> <p>Winds continue unabated through the night, blasting through the cut, and we jerkily swing on the anchor in 15 to 20 knots of wind, gusting to 25 knots. Another night of light sleep as we listen for the anchor alarm, we are now in full trust of the anchor and rode. We enjoy Amy's bespoke Sangria and dine on the fresh fish from Augustino, pan fried, on a bed of pasta and salsa of artichokes, garlic, onions, and tomatoes. The boys enjoy a movie and consume the last of the ice cream we have packed in ice in the cool-box.</p> <p>Happy Summer Solstice.</p> <p> </p> <p>Return to Home</p>","tags":["Baja California Sur","Isla Partida","Isla Espiritu Santo"]},{"location":"Ensenada_Candelero_20230622/","title":"Ensedada Candelero: 22 June 2023","text":"","tags":["Isla Espiritu Santo"]},{"location":"Ensenada_Candelero_20230622/#route","title":"Route","text":"Location Latitude Longitude Caleta Partido 24.533 N 110.380 W Ensenada Candelero 24.505 N 110.387 W","tags":["Isla Espiritu Santo"]},{"location":"Ensenada_Candelero_20230622/#journal","title":"Journal","text":"<p>In the morning, Michael and Tobias are picked up in a 24-foot panga by a local scuba diving guide and head to a wreck and island for 2 scuba dives.</p> <p>Amy, Magda, Zarko, Asher, Aleks and Maks prepare to explore the local reef, which juts out from a cactus-laden rock island which is the inspiration for the name of the cove, El Candelero. Griegito Conchito delivers the crew to a small mooring where we tie up and swim to the tiny beach, obviously interrupting the gulls taking up residence there. We snorkel around the penninsula-like reef, another aquarium-like experience. Asher is working hard on his free diving abilities and is proud to present Mum with a sunset-themed shell.</p> <p>After gathering supplies back on Grieg, the same crew heads to the beach for some badminton and beach play. Asher and Maks create a little sand fortress for fiddler crabs, while the others take turns in and out of the water at at leisurely pace. Amy spies a familiar boat heading into the cove, one that provided some heated discussion the night before, as the group there, flying an American flag, provided more nighttime light pollution than any other vessel seen. Today, the boat seems to be heading much too fast right toward the projecting reef. Sure enough, there's an abrupt stop, reveresal, and quick getaway, their proverbial tail between their legs, potentailly punctured hull. This provides further topic of evaluation and discussion, some amusement and also disgust. Then, Amy and Magda enjoy a shallow jacuzzi spa in the sun-warmed lagoon waters before departing back to rejoin Michael and Tobias on Grieg. </p> <p>In the late afternoon, the Neumann four return to the beach, southern lobe, to explore the lagoon, largely drained and evaporated from earlier in the day, when Michael exclaims the unexpected: \"I hear a goat.\" Sure enough, we stop to listen to the distant calls and make our way toward the sound. Eventually we spy about 12 goats, including young ones, making their way away from us and up the steep, harsh, terracotta hued rock, as only goats can. A few stay low and begin to drink, which makes us wonder if there is a fresh water spring. But a quick taste test confirms the water is salty, and we wonder how these creatures evolve to live here.</p> <p>The afternoon slips into the evening with snacks and, of course, rounds of Sleeping Queens, which has become the game of choice for the trip.</p> <p>Michael takes the boys for an evening snorkel around El Candelero as the sun is setting, prime creature hunting time. We find green eels, many spotted box fish, and varied tropicals. The description seems varied from the morning cast of marine characters, not uncommon as the fauna cycles through the day. We surface to a burning sunset and quickly return to boat to gather Amy and Magda for the spectacle. We float together, watching the sun slowly sink in subtle orange-blaze against the stunning massif of Sierra de la Giganta.</p> <p>Tobias opts to sleep under the expanse of the Milky Way wrapped in the main-sail lazy-jacks, masthead light tracing a pendulum arc across constellations and galaxies. Wise decision. During the night, the small beach of the reef, enjoyed that morning, is swallowed by the tide. Amy watches the sunrise beneath Tobias' nighttime roost.</p>","tags":["Isla Espiritu Santo"]},{"location":"Ensenada_Candelero_20230622/#scuba-diving","title":"Scuba Diving","text":"<p>Fang Ming: Revenge of the Tortugas</p> <p>Dove the Fang Ming, a Chinese fishing trawler that was confiscated and subsequently sunk by the Mexican Navy for illegal fshing and human trafficing. Wreck dive, max depth of 21.3 meters, bottom temperature 26 degrees. Landed in sandy bottom at 21.3 meters, starboard side of the wreck. Always odd to see a massive ship sitting on the bottom of the sea floor. Forward to the bow, covered in sea fans. Around the bow, down the port side and up to 18 meters. Penetrated the port side, moving athwartships, exiting the starboard. Interior excrusted, many fish. Torch on, Tobias expertly navigates his first wreck penetration. Re-enter the starboard side and begin to move aft through what was likely crew living space and fish processing area, many large fish hiding in the corners, schools for Cortez Rainbow Wrasse. Tobias, again expertly navigates a confined space with limited overhead. Exit onto the stern deck, cargo holds open. Turtles lounging on the aft deck now ownig the ship that once likley illegally hunted them. From the center of the aft deck over the port rail and forwad to the pilot-house, slowly peeking over the port rail we spot a massive, male, green sea-turtle. A green eel pokes its head out of a port hole. Through the port pilot house door, which is very tight, I get stuck for a moment. We have to go single file through the small pilot house. Many small Jewelled Moray Eels throughout the wreck living on pipes and crevases. Out the starboard pilot house door and to the bow, anchor windlass still intact, more sea turtles, one lounging on the bow mast-head, which we get to briefly swim with. Amazing dive.</p> <p>Tail of the Whale: Tranquillo</p> <p>Dove the western tail of Isla Ballena, a small island just south of Ensenada Candelero. Max depth 17.2 meters, bottom temperature 25 degrees. Landed in jumbled rocks, moving west along the sand-rock interface. Large school of Cortez Sea Chubs moving to deep water. Many nudibranchs, at least 4 types. Tobias observes a nudibranch, which is wrapped around a piece of seaweed, attack its own tail, extending its mouth onto itself. Giant Hawkfish. Green Eeels. First part of the dive progresses like a cool sub-tropical Pacific dive, jumbled rocks, sea stars, sea cucuumbers. As we ascend from 15 meters to 10 meters we pass through a sharp thermocline, schlerring, and the entire ecosystem transitions to a tropical environemnt, replete with colorful schools of fish and sand flats dotted by rocky outcrops. Stong current transitions the dive into a drift and we float, soar, along the sand flats observing the tropical aquarium.</p> <p> </p> <p>Return to Home</p>","tags":["Isla Espiritu Santo"]},{"location":"Ensenada_Grande_20230618/","title":"Ensenada Grande: 18 June 2023","text":"","tags":["Baja California Sur","Isla Partida"]},{"location":"Ensenada_Grande_20230618/#route","title":"Route","text":"Location Latitude Longitude La Paz 24.214 N 110.299 W Estero Balandra 24.316 N 110.335 W Ensenada Grande 24.560 N 110.396 W","tags":["Baja California Sur","Isla Partida"]},{"location":"Ensenada_Grande_20230618/#journal","title":"Journal","text":"<p>Today, Sunday, we set sail on our charter boat Grieg at 10:30 from La Paz into the Sea of Cortez.

Thankful for all the monements that have brought me here.</p> <p>Our transit to La Paz is characterized by an easy 7 minute walk from the United States of America to the United Mexican States. It is a short distance across an invisible boundary, but the change is real. Observing the people in the airport, and the passengars on the flight, I was struck by the differnces of morphology, clothing, tone, and demeanor of the populous when compared to the citizens on the US side of the border. In this hyper-conected world where nearly all things flow freely, how can there be such a ditinct differnce of demographics in such little distance? It seems the natural diffusion of culture, genes, and ethos should create a more homogeneous distrubution. This dicontinuitiy becomes even more of a paradox when we purchase a carton of blue-berries in La Paz, Mexico, that are the same as the ones we purchase in Mission Viejo, California. How can commodites be identical over a vast distance, while people and culture have a marked discontinutiy over a mostly permeable and permissive border? It seems human existence and condition should be more homogenous, more evenly distributed, over space and time.</p> <p>Winds continue to build. I had read about Coromuels in pilot guides. Steinbeck dedicates some words to them. I didn't expect \"evening\" to translate to 21:30, and didn't expect to contend with them on night one out of port.

Typically, few people are out and you can quickly survey a city for core needs, locations, and areas of concern. We zip through La Paz, good to drive a manual transmission vehicle, and locate several banks, the core business district with shops and restaurants, and identify key north-south and east-west thoroughfares. We visit an ATM to get Mexican Pesos and make a stop at the local dive shop to arrange our scuba adventure. The dive shop visit spawns additional stops at several marine and camping supply outlets as we attempt, successfully, to replace the dive weights that were confiscated at the Tijuana Airport.</p> <p>We return to Nahuala Home.

At 11:00, the marina calls and informs us we can board the boat at 14:00 and that we should come to the marina to complete paperwork and recieve familiarization and safety briefing at 13:00. It's on.

We again pile into the Urvan, destined for Walmart to procure 7 days worth of provisions.</p> <p>We decide to take the inland route, which loops through the coastal range and into the desert outskirts of La Paz. The landscape is beautiful, rocky, dotted with cactus. As we approach the outskirts of the city, small settlements and houses punctuate the landscape. Hard to imagine this life, but we try to initiate conversation with the kids about it anyway. It passes in a blur. This is part of our time here: noticing how people live life differently, appreciating those differences, and relfecting on our, very different, reality. We, ultimatley, connect to the main highway and are bound for Walmart.</p> <p>We park and enter the massive store, looking exactly as you would expect any Walmart, and then split into several groups to try and attack, as fast as we can, the problem of buying provisions for 8 people, for 7 days. It's a bit chaotic, we manage it in 2 hours, consuming food and drink as we seek, find, and procure our stores. Food and crew fill the van and we speed back to the boat to unload and enjoy a night in the marina.

We first sail toward Isla Espiritu Santo, we want to get into the channel between the island and the main-land so we can release some \"messages in a bottle.\" The boys have each placed a message in a wine bottle, which we then re-cork and seal. We are hoping they journey on the sea before washing ashore to be found. We have included an email address in the note so whomever finds them can contact us. Once we release the bottles, we head to CostaBaja Marina, replenish Grieg's fuel, and return to the slip. </p> <p>We pack and clean, Zarko heads off to pick-up the Urvan, which is typically delayed, giving us ample time to unload and relax in the marina. Once he returns, we, again, pile our gear and crew into the van and head to Nahuala Home. We have opted for the same accomodations on return, knowing the familairity will ease our reintegration to society. After settling gear, claiming beds, showering, and having a few beats of relaxing, Michael, Amy, Asher, Tobias, and Aleks go for a walk in La Paz. We stroll the Malecon, visit the scuba shop to retrieve my knife, which I left inside the pocket of the rented BCD, and enjoy a shaved ice in the sweltering heat. For a moment, a long moment, it feels like we live here, in our hearts and souls we now do. We begin to make plans to return in December.</p> <p>In the evening, a quick round of souvenir shopping, a final swim at the beach, and another sumptuous meal at La Peregrina. The night closes early, we are all tired after this amazing adventure. We sleep well, with sadness, that tomorrow we depart, dreaming of a December return: 1,000 nautical miles from Long Beach to La Paz...  </p> <p> </p> <p>Return to Home</p>","tags":["Baja California Sur"]},{"location":"Photo_Gallery/","title":"Photo Gallery","text":"<p>Sea of Cortez 2023 Photo Gallery</p>"},{"location":"San_Evaristo_20230620/","title":"San Evaristo: 20 June 2023","text":"","tags":["Isla San Francisco","Isla San Jose","Baja California Sur"]},{"location":"San_Evaristo_20230620/#route","title":"Route","text":"Location Latitude Longitude Isla San Francisco (East) 24.829 N 110.566 W Isla San Jose, La Amortajada 24.868 N 110.570 W San Evaristo 24.913 N 110.702 W","tags":["Isla San Francisco","Isla San Jose","Baja California Sur"]},{"location":"San_Evaristo_20230620/#journal","title":"Journal","text":"<p>In the morning, wind fresh and building form the north, we motor, wind on the nose to La Amortajada, a mangrove-forest lagoon encircled and protected by a massive sand spit. Enroute we spot jumping Dorado propelling their turquois-yellow-green masses out of the water, either in pursuit of prey or being pursued as prey. We arrive to La Amortajada on a flooding tide and take the dinghy in 2 shifts to explore the mangrove forest, Neumann Family on Trip 1, Popov Family on Trip 2.</p> <p>Inside the sand spit bastion lies a vast mangrove ecosystem ranging from clear sand-bottom shallows to dense mangroves cut with tidal channels, silty and tannic dark waters. We see many sea tutrles, unidentified fish, rays, potential baby hammer-head sharks, sea birds and raptors.  </p> <p>Neumann Family arrives at the lagoon opening during a strong flood tide, channel unnavigable, water heavily rushing over a rocky bottom as the morning exchange with the sea begins. Michael, Amy, Asher, and Tobias exit the dinghy and drag the tender across the rocks and into the lagoon, then falling into the deep drop-off just inside the lagoon. We scramble back into the boat and explore the mangroves sometimes under power, sometimes drifting silently under paddle, or walking slowly in sand-botom, or silty-muck bottom, pulling the dinghy. Exiting the lagoon is equally chaotic as the flood tide is still strong and water depth not navigable. We slightly miss-time the exit from the dinghy to walk it across the laggon entrance and in the seconds of miss-timing Asher and Tobias exit the bow, Amy and Michael off the stern into shoulder deep, rushing water, that renders us useless in moving the dinghy. Mild panic ensues and the boat begins to be swept back into the lagoon. Asher and Tobias have to pull the dinghy, Amy and Michael holding on, to a point that all can work to move the boat through the entrance. It is slow going as the under-powered dinghy struggles against the flood. We beleive we spot juvenile hammer heads also transiting the entrance.    </p> <p>During Trip 1, local fisherman approach Grieg and ask the Popov Family for some water, they share a 6 liter jug of water, a precious commodity for us on a boat in 100-degree temperatures. The fisherman retreat to the shade of foiliage along the crest of the sand spit, seeking refuge from the scorching temperatures and strong north winds.  </p> <p>As we leave La Amortajada, on our way to the fishing village of San Evaristo, the wind is gusting above 20 knots from the north. We again motorsail, wind on the nose.</p> <p>We tuck into the northern lobe of the bay and anchor in sandy bottom in 3 fathoms of water. There is a large white cross at the top of the steep hill engulfing the cove. Maybe it is a reminder, maybe for protection for the fishermen, but not the only one we would encounter.We enjoy afternoon swimming and snorkeling with decent visibility of 20 feet, various fish, among rocky bottom interspersed with sand. Asher hones his diving skill hunting for shells.</p> <p>We discover a large grass hopper lounging on our bimini and name him Pin. We wonder how long he haas been transiting, could he have been a co-resident with us from La Paz? We carefully move around him as to not scare him into the water and then decide it is best to release him on land. Tobias spearheads plans to hold him in a container and make a trip to shore to release him.</p> <p>17:05</p> <p>Mild panic ensues as the continuous running water pump, and gurgling sound of an empty water tank, alerts us to the fact that we have exhausted half our water supply in 3 days. We switch to the second tank, and thankfully realize we can take the dinghy into the only town on the itinierary, or really anywhere, to scrounge for water. We first re-inflate and restructure the crushed plastic water bottles we have been discarding as we use our potable water supply, it is, afterall, Mexico, which means you must only drink bottled water. Then, off we go, under the sputtering engine of the dinghy, into the fishing village of San Evaristo; Michael, Zarko, and Tobias, with 6, 6-liter, empty platic jugs, in search of water. Upon arrival, there are kids of all ages playing soccer. Here, again, is a reminder that people around the world live differently, but also the same! We are directed to Augustino, who happily shares water, karmic given the water we shared with the fishermen earlier in the day. An hour later we are headed back to Grieg with 6, full, 6-liter jusgs, and a 40-liter carboy that we have borrowed from our new local fisherman friend. Tobias releases Pin. An hour after that, we have partially filled Grieg's watertank, forced 200 pesos into the hand of Augustino, and parted with 2 bottles of wine for his deeply human kindness to share one of the most precious assets he has in this extreme desert environment. Deep thanks for the kindness of this human, an interesting full circle moment as we have today shared the precious commodity of water and recieved a ten-fold kindness.       </p> <p>20:17</p> <p>Our first moon-rise of the trip presents as a waxing yellow-orange crescent accompanied by Jupiter rising over the encircling, rocky, hills. It sets equally beautifully and, as the boat swings, comes back into view gracing us with a second moon-set. Another windy night at anchor, and our trust in the rode and anchor is beginning to build. As darkness spreads, bioluminescence fills the bay.</p> <p> </p> <p>Return to Home</p>","tags":["Isla San Francisco","Isla San Jose","Baja California Sur"]},{"location":"tags/","title":"Articles by Tags","text":""},{"location":"tags/#baja-california-sur","title":"Baja California Sur","text":"<ul> <li>Caleta Lobos</li> <li>Caleta Partida</li> <li>Ensenada Grande</li> <li>La Paz</li> <li>La Paz</li> <li>La Paz</li> <li>San Evaristo</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#isla-espiritu-santo","title":"Isla Espiritu Santo","text":"<ul> <li>Caleta Lobos</li> <li>Caleta Partida</li> <li>Ensenada Candelero</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#isla-partida","title":"Isla Partida","text":"<ul> <li>Caleta Partida</li> <li>Ensenada Grande</li> <li>Isla San Francisco</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#isla-san-francisco","title":"Isla San Francisco","text":"<ul> <li>Isla San Francisco</li> <li>San Evaristo</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#isla-san-jose","title":"Isla San Jose","text":"<ul> <li>San Evaristo</li> </ul> <p>Return to Revista</p>"},{"location":"tags/","title":"Articles by Tags","text":""},{"location":"tags/#baja-california-sur","title":"Baja California Sur","text":"<ul> <li>Caleta Lobos</li> <li>Caleta Partida</li> <li>Ensenada Grande</li> <li>La Paz</li> <li>La Paz</li> <li>La Paz</li> <li>San Evaristo</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#isla-espiritu-santo","title":"Isla Espiritu Santo","text":"<ul> <li>Caleta Lobos</li> <li>Caleta Partida</li> <li>Ensenada Candelero</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#isla-partida","title":"Isla Partida","text":"<ul> <li>Caleta Partida</li> <li>Ensenada Grande</li> <li>Isla San Francisco</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#isla-san-francisco","title":"Isla San Francisco","text":"<ul> <li>Isla San Francisco</li> <li>San Evaristo</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#isla-san-jose","title":"Isla San Jose","text":"<ul> <li>San Evaristo</li> </ul> <p>Return to Revista</p>"}]}
