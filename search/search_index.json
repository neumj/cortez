The action triggers chaos as Michael and the boys move rapidly move to get on snorkel gear on. The moubula rays pass the bow and we are in pursuit as the rays breach their way across the cove. The rays escape interaction but several breach and land within 15 to 20 feet of us.</p> <p>After the excitement of the chase, Amy, Zarko, Magda, Maks, Aleks, and Asher take the dinghy into the village of San Evaristo to purchase fresh fish from Augustino. Tobias and Michael wrangle the anchor aboard and move the boat closer to the village for a hot-boat pick-up. A mobula ray nearly lands on the swim step as we hold the boat for the shore crew. In the village the boys play with Augustino's dogs, running on the beach. Zarko, Amy, and Magda purchase fresh Conchita from Augustino, possibly the [Cortez Sea Chub]. Augustino offers his daughter's ceviche preparation skill if we can only wait an hour and a half. We have long sail ahead and opt to return in the future for a fresh ceviche. </p> <p>We manage a hot-boat pick up from the dinghy and depart San Evaristo at 10:17 under a north wind of 10 to 15 knots and building. Our destination lies 32 nauticals miles south, which Tobias has determined the day before via chart, compass, and parallel rule. We raise sail and run downwind, wing and wing, sea and winds building through the day.</p> <p>Amy and Magda join the Mariners' Club, alongside Tobias, learning the art of navigation, determining and plotting our postion, and charting our course as we run to Isla Partida.</p> <p>The dinghy earns a name, Griegito Conchito, as we watch it surf and bob along as we tow it behind us in 20 knots of winds and 1 meter seas.</p> <p>In the early afternoon winds are gusting to 25 knots and seas running out of the north at 1 meter, lifting our stern rythmically. As we reach the trough of a deep roll, we spot a large manta ray surfing our direction, we attempt to chase the massive creature downwind, without success. On our final approach to Caleta Partida we spot dolphins off the port bow, and as soon as we see them, they are gone. We again spot them to our stern, their large bodies and slow movement leads us to beliecve they may be Rizzo's Dolphins. We are on anchor in sand bottom by 15:30. </p> <p>The shallows of Caleta Partido are replete with turtles, rays, bait fish, and sea birds. We spot an eagle ray and each family spots schools of rays and turtles as they take the dinghy through the cut between Isla Partida and Isla Espiritu Santo, which provides a corridor to the open Sea of Cortez. We take a few moments to explore the shallows and coarse white-sand beach that provides a butress between the islands.</p> <p>Winds continue unabated, blasting through the cut, and we jerkily swing on the anchor in 15 to 20 knots of wind through the night. Another night of light sleep as we listen for the anchor alarm. We enjoy Amy's bespoke Sangria and dine on the fresh fish from Augustino, pan fried, on a bed of pasta and salsa of artichokes, garlic, onions, and tomatos.

Always odd to see a massive ship sitting on the bottom of the sea floor. Forward to the bow, coverd in sea fans. Around the bow, down the port side and up to 18 meters. Penetrated the prot side, moving athwartships, exiting the starboard. Interior excrusted, many fish. Torch on, Tobias expertly navigates his first wreck penetration.

Turtles lounging on the aft deck now ownig the ship that once likley illegally hunted them. From the center of the aft deck over the port rail and forwad to the pilot-house, slowly peeking over the port rail we spot a massive, male, green sea-turtle.

Tobias observes a nudibranch, which is wrapped around a piece of seaweed, attack its own tail, extending its mouth onto itself. Giant hawkfish. Green Eeels. First part of the dive progresses like a cool sub tropical pacific dive, jumbled rocks, sea stars, sea cucuumbers. As we ascend from 15 meters to 10 meters we pass through a sharp thermocline, schlerring, and the entire ecosystem transitions to a tropical environemnt, replete with colorful schools of fish and sand flats dotted by rocky outcrops.

The sunrise painted a pastel beginning, dark forms of frigate birds and pelicans moving through the sky hunting bait fish below. After re-positioning Grieg, ceding appatently valubale territory to the bees and wasps, we headed for the shore. Michael, Amy, Magda, Maks, Aleks, Tobias, and Asher took the dinghy to the main beach of Ensenada Grande. Michael and Amy undertook a short hike up the main canyon which provided a postcard view of the valley, beach, and anchorage. Magda and boys enjoyed the beach, snorkeling, and exploring the shallow cove. Upon returing from the hike, we noticed thousands of small fiddler-crabs along the lagoon-land interface. The boys then spent time herding the crabs and exploring the lagoon.</p> <p>No wind meant a motor-sail with hopes of a building breeze. Impromptu stop in Caleta El Embudo, which wildly exceeded expectations with a bed of thousands of Cortez Garden Eels swaying on the bottom, retreating as we dove to inspect. Many, many, varied fish. After pulling the anchr from sandy bottom if Caleta El Embudo, we motorsail around Los Islotes to visit the sea-lion rookery and then onto Isla San Francisco. Little to no wind keeps us under motor and gives Asher and Aleks an opportuity to lounge in the main-sail. We opt to head to the north end of Isla San Franciso to explore the lagoon, Tobais hoping to find a hammer-head shark nursery. Alex and Asher undertake some \"Navy Seal Training\" hanging off the side of the dinghy as we sped to shore. Lagoon is heavily brackish and seems to not have regular interchange. Isla San Franciso presents a stunning landscape, rising from the sea.</p> <p>Given our experience the previous night with The Coromuel, we opt to anchor on the east side of Isla San Francisco for the night. Swimming and jumping off the bow ensues as Zarko wrangles the grill into submission and production of heat. Before sunset we survey the bay to scount for viable night snorkeling locations, which after dinner, yields a first-time night snorkel for Tobias, Amy, and Magda. Under the glow of the Milky-Way we see varied fish, many large puffer fish, large spotted box fish, WORM, and 2 surly green eels, which simultaeoulsy leave us in awe and stike fear. Asher, Alex, Maks, and Zarko learn the differnce between fishing and catching, losing several large fish and breaking a rod before landing a Cortez Grunt.

Enroute we spot jumping Dorado propelling their turquois-yellow-green masses out of the water either in pursuit of prey or being pursued as prey. We arrive to La Amortajada on a flooding tide and take the dinghy in 2 shifts to explore the mangrove forest, Neumann Family on Trip 1, Popov Family on Trip 2.</p> <p>Inside the sand spit bastion lies a vast mangrove ecosystem ranging from clear sand-bottom shallows to dense mangroves cut with tidal channels, silty and tannic dark waters. Many sea tutrles, unidentified fish, rays, potential baby hammer-head sharks, sea birds and raptors.  </p> <p>Neumann Family arrives at the lagoon opening during a strong flood tide, channel unnavigable, water heavily rushing over a rocky bottom as the morning exchange with the sea begins. Michael, Amy, Asher, and Tobias exit the dinghy and drag the tender across the rocks and into the lagoon, then falling into the deep drop-off just inside the lagoon. We scramble back into the boat and explore the mangroves sometimes under power, sometimes drifting silently under paddle or walking slowly in sand-botom or silty-muck bottom pulling the dinghy. Exiting the lagoon is equally chaotic as the flood tide is still strong and water depth not navigable. We slightly miss-time the exit from the dinghy to walk it across the laggon entrance and in the seconds of miss-timing Asher and Tobias exit the bow, Amy and Michael off the stern into shoulder deep, rushing water, that renders them useless in moving the dinghy. Mild panic ensues and the boat begins to be swept back into the lagoon. Asher and Tobias have to pull the dinghy, Amy and Michael holding on, to a point that all can work to move the boat through the entrance. It is slow going as the under-powered dinghy struggles against the flood, and we beleive we spot juvenile hammer heads also transiting the entrance.    </p> <p>During Trip 1, local fisherman approach Grieg and ask the Popov Family for some water, they share a 6 liter jug of water, a precious commodity for us on a boat in 100-degree temperatures. The fisherman retreat to the shade of foiliage along the crest of the sand spit, seeking refuge from 100 degree temperatures and strong north winds.  </p> <p>As we leave La Amortajada, the wind is gusting above 20 knots from the north and we are again motorsailing on the nose, on our way to the fishing village of San Evaristo.</p> <p>We tuck into the northern lobe of the bay and anchor in sandy bottom in 3 fathoms of water. Swimming and snorkeling with decent visibility of 20 feet, various fish, among rocky bottom interspersed with sand. Asher hones his diving skill hunting for shells.</p> <p>We discover a large grass hopper lounging on our bimini and name him Pin. We wonder how long he haas been transiting, could he have been a co-resident with us from La Paz? We decide it is best to release him on land and begin to make plans to hold him in a container and make a trip to shore to release him.</p> <p>17:05</p> <p>Mild panic ensues as the continuous running water pump and gurgling sound of an empty water tank alerts us to the fact that we have exhisted half our water supply in 3 days. We switch to the second tank, and thankfully realize we can take the dinghy into town to scrounge for water. We first re-inlate and restructure the crushed plastic water bottles we have been discarding as we use our potable water supply, it is, afterall, Mexico, which means you must only drink bottled water. Then, off we go, under the sputtering engine of the dinghy, into the fishing village of San Evaristo; Michael, Zarko, and Tobias, with 6, 6-liter, empty platic jugs, in search of water. An hour later we are headed back to Grieg with 6, full, 6-liter jusgs, and a 40-liter carboy that we have borrowed from our new local fisherman friend Augustino. Tobias releases Pin. An hour after that, we have partially filled Grieg's watertank, forced 200 pesos into the hand of Augustino, and parted with 2 bottle of wine for his deeply human kindness to share one of the most preciosu assets in this extreme desert environment. Deep thanks for the knindness of this human, and interesting full circle moment as we have today shared the preciosu commity of water and recieved a ten-fold kindness.       </p> <p>20:17</p> <p>Our first moon-rise of the trip presents as a waxing yellow-orange crescent accompanied by Jupiter rising over the encircling, rocky, hills.

An easy 7 minute walk and you've moved from the United States of America to the XYZ of Mexico. It is a short distance across an invisible boundary, but the change is real. Observing the people in the airport, and the passengars on the flight, I was struck by the differnces of morphology, clothing, tone, and demeanor of the populous when compared to the citizens on the US side of the border. In this hyper-conected world where nearly all things flow freely, how can there be such a ditinct differnce of demographics in such little distance? It seems the natural diffusion of culture, genes, and ethos should create a more homogeneous distrubution. This dicontinutiy becomes even more of a paradox when we purchase a carton of blue-berries in La Paz, Mexico, that are the same as the ones we purchase in Mission Viejo, California. How can commodites be identical over a vast distance, while people and culture have a marked discontinutiy over a mostly permeable and permissive border?
